	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">With this release the <span class="ph pname">UI development toolkit for HTML5</span>
			(<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>) is upgraded from
		version 1.24 to 1.26.</p>

		<p class="p">The following sections highlight the main new features and enhancements to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. <span class="ph">For a complete,
				detailed list of all new and enhanced functions, see: <a class="xref" href="../../releasenotes.html" alt="../../releasenotes.html" title="../../releasenotes.html">Change Log</a>.</span></p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Main New Features</div><div type="Main New Features">
			
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">New OData Model Implementation</span>: Features greatly improved two-way binding
				and $batch support, as well as improved performance overall through reduced and more
				asynchronous requests. <span class="ph">For more information,
					see the <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel.html">API Reference documentation</a>.</span></p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Support for Windows Phone</span> (IE11 in Windows Phone 8.1 update 1): This
				support is valid for the following libraries (those supporting mobile devices):
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.unified</samp>. </p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Usability Enhancements - Keyboard Shortcuts</span>: Version 1.26 contains
				enhanced usability features, including new keyboard shortcuts for SAPUI5
				controls.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Usability Enhancements - High Contrast Black</span>: Version 1.26 also includes
				High Contrast Black (HCB) theme support for the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> library.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Fast Keyboard Navigation</span>: The new fast keyboard navigation allows you to
				navigate quickly between groups using <kbd class="key">F6</kbd>. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="10b14c7284ba48a185ae2046db470706.html" title="Adjacent controls within the tab chain can be grouped. Within such a group, F6 skips all controls of the group and moves the focus to the first control in the tab chain of the next group. Shift F6 moves the focus to the first control of the previous group. Adjacent tab chain elements between groups are automatically handled as one group. For nested groups, the most concrete group is used.">Defining Groups for Fast Navigation (F6)</a>.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Mobile Diagnostics</span>: We have improved the structure of the mobile
				diagnostics dialog and added a new function for end-to-end (E2E) tracing. You can
				now open the dialog with the following touch combination: press two fingers on a
				non-interactive screen area (for example, a blank area) for at least 3 seconds, then
				tap with a third finger while still holding the other two on the screen. For more
				information, see <a class="xref" href="616a3ef07f554e20a3adf749c11f64e9.html" title="OpenUI5 features a technical information dialog that provides you with information and functions that you can use within an existing OpenUI5 desktop or mobile application. The look and feature set of this dialog is different for desktop and mobile devices, as outlined below.">Technical Information Dialog</a>.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">jQuery 1.11.1</span>: This version of jQuery is now used by default.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Extensibility</span>: ExtensionPoints are now also offered in JSViews and
				controls can be hidden in all View types.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">OPA (One Page Acceptance) Tests</span>: The OPA tests have been improved. There
				is now a new way to structure your OPA tests: If you have multiple pages or UI areas
				that have several operations, you should place them as reuse functionality in page
				objects to make your OPA tests easier to maintain.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><samp class="ph codeph">Visible</samp> Attribute</span>: A <samp class="ph codeph">visible</samp> attribute
				is now available for all controls, as they now inherit this property from the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Control</samp> class.</p>

			
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">New Node Type for <samp class="ph codeph">sap.suite.ui.commons.ProcessFlow</samp></span>: The
				node type <span class="ph uicontrol">Planned with Issue</span> is now available for
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.suite.ui.commons.ProcessFlow</samp>, meaning you can now choose
				between using a node <span class="ph uicontrol">Planned</span> without a status, or with the
				status <span class="ph uicontrol">Planned with Issue</span>.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Main New Controls</div><div type="Main New Controls">
			
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.FixFlex</samp></span>: This new control addresses the
				common layout use case where one part of the UI has a certain size (which may be
				set, or may be defined by the content size) and the other part of the UI should use
				all of the remaining space (horizontally and vertically). It also supports Internet
				Explorer 9 (which is not supported by the more powerful
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Flexbox</samp> control).</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.RadioButtonGroup</samp></span>: This new control improves the
				use of layouting, keyboard navigation and data binding for radio buttons. <span class="ph">For more information,
					see the <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.RadioButtonGroup/preview" alt="../../explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.RadioButtonGroup/preview" title="../../explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.RadioButtonGroup/preview">Explored</a> example in the Demo

					Kit.</span></p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.UploadCollection</samp></span>: This new control is a list
				control for attachment management. It is based on the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.unified.FileUploader</samp> control and allows you to upload,
				edit or delete attachments. <span class="ph">For more
					information, see the <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.m.UploadCollection.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.m.UploadCollection.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.m.UploadCollection.html">API Reference Documentation</a> or the <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.UploadCollection/samples" alt="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.UploadCollection/samples" title="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.UploadCollection/samples">Explored</a> example in the Demo Kit.</span></p>
