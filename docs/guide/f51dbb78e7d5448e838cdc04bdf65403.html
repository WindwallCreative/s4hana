				<p class="p">We strongly suggest that you use stable IDs whenever possible, since they are an important
					prerequisite for <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> flexibility, automated testing, and inline help tools (such as Web
					Assistant). Apps with missing stable IDs are of worse quality and offer less
					functionality to customers. However, some technical controls don't need stable
					IDs (see note below).</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="section" id="loiof51dbb78e7d5448e838cdc04bdf65403__section_gtm_xlp_3z"><div class="section_title">Background: Why Are Stable IDs Needed?</div><div type="Background: Why Are Stable IDs Needed?">
			
			<p class="p">By default, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> generates IDs
				for instantiated controls. For example, the page and the table in the following XML
				view could have the generated IDs <samp class="ph codeph">__page0</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">__table0</samp> at runtime.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;mvc:View
   xmlns="sap.m"
   xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"&gt;
   &lt;Page&gt;
      &lt;content&gt;
         &lt;Table&gt;
         &lt;/Table&gt;
      &lt;/content&gt;
   &lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;
</pre></div>

			<p class="p">These generated IDs change whenever the control structure of the app changes. They are also
				influenced during instantiation. If there are two views with unstable IDs in the
				app, depending on the order the views are opened, each view could get the generated
				ID <samp class="ph codeph">__view0</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">__view1</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">This is an issue for the following features that require stable IDs:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loiof51dbb78e7d5448e838cdc04bdf65403__ul_t4q_53h_kz">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span>
							flexibility</p>

						<p class="p">Allows you to extend apps based on your requirements, for example, by
							creating variants or adapting the user interface at runtime. Stable IDs
							are used to identify the controls that are to be adapted. </p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Automated tests</p>

						<p class="p">To check the behavior of apps at runtime, these tests find controls by
							searching for stable IDs. The amount of stable IDs required depends on
							the respective framework. If you use OPA in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>,
							you're able to find controls via other criteria like control type,
							display name and others. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="2696ab50faad458f9b4027ec2f9b884d.html" title="OPA5 is an API for OpenUI5 controls. It hides asynchronicity and eases access to OpenUI5 elements. This makes OPA especially helpful for testing user interactions, integration with OpenUI5, navigation, and data binding.">Integration Testing with One Page Acceptance Tests (OPA5)</a>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Inline help tools</p>

						<p class="p">These tools display user assistance information directly in the app and
							depend on stable IDs (example: Web Assistant).</p>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">The solution for this is that you as an application developer set the IDs manually to keep
				them stable. For example, if you set the ID of the following XML view, the contained
				page and table would have the IDs <samp class="ph codeph">myView--page</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">myView--table</samp> at runtime.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;mvc:View
   xmlns="sap.m"
   xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"&gt;
   &lt;Page id="page"&gt;
      &lt;content&gt;
         &lt;Table id="table"&gt;
         &lt;/Table&gt;
      &lt;/content&gt;
   &lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;
</pre></div>

			<p class="p">The XML view prefixes the control IDs with its own ID. This allows you to use the
				same control ID for different views and to use the same view multiple times. For
				more information, see <a class="xref" href="91f28be26f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="Stable IDs are used to identify and modify the controls within the controller during runtime. However, if you reuse or nest these views, these stable IDs are no longer unique. To avoid ambiguity, each view adds its own ID as prefix to all its child controls.">Support for Unique IDs</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">For JavaScript views, JavaScript-generated controls, and XML-based views, you have to
				use the <samp class="ph codeph">createID</samp> method of the view or control for this
				purpose.</p>

			<div class="p">
				<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
					<p class="p">If after a software upgrade some controls disappeared or the way in which
						they can be identified changed, this has a direct impact on the features
						relying on stable IDs. For this reason, the IDs must be kept stable over the
						lifecycle of the app; they are part of the public API of the app.</p>

The file name either ends with .view.xml or as an XML string. The file name and the folder structure together specify the name of the view that equals the OpenUI5 module name.">XML View</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">The standard use case is that you use stable IDs for the view that the router
				navigates to. Ideally, you create your views with routing targets and declare the
				view ID in the manifest instead of setting it yourself in the view (as shown in the
				example below). For more information, see <a class="xref" href="3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5.html" title="OpenUI5 offers hash-based navigation, which allows you to build single-page apps where the navigation is done by changing the hash. In this way the browser does not have to reload the page; instead there is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react. A hash string is parsed and matched against patterns which will then inform the handlers.">Routing and Navigation</a> and <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>

         }
      }
   }
}
</pre></div>

			<p class="p">If you do not use the standard use case, you embed your view by setting its ID (the
				ID for the enclosing view is generated as in the previous example). Here's an
				example:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;mvc:View xmlns="sap.m"
xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"&gt;
&lt;Page id="page"&gt;

&lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;

			<div class="p">
				<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">Bear in mind that some technical controls, such as
							<samp class="ph codeph">CustomData</samp> or aggregation binding templates, don't need
						stable IDs. Also do not set stable IDs for controls in bound aggregations
						because it's not actually possible. For example, the items in the following
						table are generated along the bound data and therefore cannot have stable
						IDs.</p>

					<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;mvc:View

         &lt;!-- no ID is set for controls in the bound 'items' aggregation --&gt;
         &lt;ColumnListItem&gt;
            &lt;!--template elements --&gt;
         &lt;/ColumnListItem&gt;
      &lt;/items&gt;
   &lt;/Table&gt;

			<p class="p">When giving names to stable IDs, choose IDs that describe the semantics of your views and
